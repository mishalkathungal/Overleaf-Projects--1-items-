 \section{Purpose}

In today’s world, we are using online references for every doubt.There are
problems of distraction and time conception while doing traditional
referencing.This new system named ‘SenseAI’ adds a pinch of speed and
optimism to your online referencing. It provides environment to clear word wise
and topic wise immediate doubt clearances within the webpages by connecting the
user to ai.The intended audiences are vast.Mainly focuses on the people who
wants optimistic clearance of every topic being referenced and those who want
time management.These can be individuals,companies, even automated
programmes ,companies etc. The user can dictate a specific word or a paragraph
from the reference page to get explained by open ai . The purpose of this Software
Requirements Specification document is to figure out all the functions and
specifications of ‘SenseAI’.Besides it contains all the requirements specified . It
will explain the purpose and features of the system,what the system will do ,and
the constraints under which it must operate.This document is intended for both
consumers and the developers of the system.
\newpage
\section{ Intended Audience}


The intended Audience of the project is people who need productivity in
work and learning .
\section{ Scope of Project}

The existing system is a website . In the existing system , users
range from common people to scholars and researchers.When they need
the AI they need to go to the website and type in the prompt which causes
some time delay between fetching the required answer



  \underline{\textbf{Drawbacks}}

Time consuming
There is no website for accessing all the services at a single page
The techniques and UI can be confusing to common people
The proposed system is much more efficient than the existing
system. This is a Google Chrome extension which helps users to find the
answers to their queries much more easier ,timely and efficiently .The
extension acts as a one stop for all OpenAI products

\underline{\textbf{Advantages}}

Less time consuming
Easy, efficient and simple
Give quick and efficient service to users
High speed response to the users
Registration for every individual who are willing to donate

\section{System Environment}

The project Quickee involves a single user, the person who uses the
services offered by the extension .. In order to login, user has to first register by
providing the desired user-ID and password. Provided user-IDs and passwords by
the users are maintained in a database. NoSQL database is used to maintain a
database. Then the user logins in to the application by giving user-ID and
password provided during the registration process. IndexedDB is used to connect
the application with the database.

\chapter{Other Non functional Requirements}
\textit{}In software engineering non-functional requirements are requirements
which specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather
than specific behaviours. This should be contrasted with functional requirements
that specify specific behaviour or functions. Non-functional requirements are
often called qualities of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are
"constraints", "quality attributes", "quality goals" and "quality of service
requirements". Qualities, of Non-functional requirements can be divided into two
main categories. Execution qualities, such as security and usability, are observable
at run time. Evolution qualities, such as extensibility and scalability, embody in
the static structure of the software system.




\section{Performance Requirements}
\lipsum[The server on which this system will be running is expected to be available
at all hours of the day to provide full time accessibility. The system is developed
based on the client server architecture, a request-response paradigm and is
implemented with the help of a Javascript and it uses NoSQL server as back end.
Major performance requirements are:
All prompts should be loaded within 60 seconds.
The system should provide proper authentication.] % Please comment this line and type in the content


\section{Security Requirements}
\lipsum[The access to the software application will be restricted to the authorised
users identified by a valid email and password. New users can register or sign up
to the system with personal details. CAPTCHA will be included to reduce automated
login. Error messages will be displayed in the case of errors during the system access.] % Please comment this line and type in the content

\chapter{ Uml Diagrams}
\section{ Class diagram}
\textit{}Class diagrams are used to describe the structure of a system. Class
diagrams describe the system in terms of objects, classes, attributes, operations
and their associations. Objects are instances of the classes. In UML classes are
depicted by boxes composed of three compartments. The top compartment
displays the name of the class. The centre compartment displays its attributes,
and the bottom compartment displays operations. A link represents the
connection between the classes.
  \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/Screenshot (41).png}
   \end{figure}
   \section{ Sequence Diagram}
\textit{}Sequence diagram is an Interaction Diagram that describes the
patterns of communication among a set of interacting objects. An
object interacts with another object by sending messages. The
reception of message by an object triggers the execution of a
method, which in turn may send messages to other objects.
Arguments may be passed along with a message and are bound to
parameters of the executing method in the receiving object
.Sequence Diagrams represent the objects participating in the
interaction horizontally and time vertically.   
 \section{ State Chart Diagrams}
 \textit{ }State chart diagrams describe the dynamic behaviour of an
individual object as a number of states and transition between these
states. A state represents particular set of values for an object.
Given a state, a transition represents a future state the object can
move to and the conditions associated with the change of state. A
state is represented by a rounded rectangle. A transition is depicted
by open arrows connecting two states. States are labelled with their
name. A small solid black circle indicates the initial state. A circle
surrounding a small solid black circle indicates a final.
